## 👋 About Me

I enjoy automation and device integration as a hobby.

Using Home Assistant and ESPHome,
I connect various devices and build fun, sometimes unnecessary automations.

I like working with both hardware and software,
and I enjoy creating things that probably don’t need to exist.

I’m also casually exploring robotics.

### 🎯 Goal

Connect everything.
Automate everything.
